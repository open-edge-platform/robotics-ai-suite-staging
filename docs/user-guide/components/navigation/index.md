# Dynamic and Autonomous Navigation

Dynamic and autonomous navigation is the core capability that enables mobile robots—ranging from industrial Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to bipedal humanoids—to understand their surroundings, establish robust localization, safely maneuver around moving obstacles, and execute missions in unpredictable environments.

The Robotics AI Suite provides an end-to-end, hardware-accelerated navigation architecture based on **ROS 2 Nav2** (supporting ROS 2 Jazzy and Humble). This foundation is augmented by Intel-patented global path planners, adaptive spatial clustering algorithms, 3D volumetric voxel mapping, direct LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry pipelines, multi-robot collaborative SLAM, and automated re-localization.


## Navigation Architecture

The navigation stack integrates sensor feeds, high-rate state estimation, multi-layer costmaps, global trajectory planners, dynamic local controllers, and autonomous recovery mechanisms:

## Dynamic & Autonomous Navigation Capabilities

### 1. High-Performance Global Path Planning: Intel® ITS Planner
In large warehouse layouts or crowded factory floors with thousands of navigation nodes, traditional grid-search algorithms such as $A^*$ or Dijkstra can exhibit severe calculation latency when planning complex routes. The **Intelligent Sampling and Two-Way Search (ITS)** global path planner accelerates route calculation by **20–30x** over $A^*$ on 1,000-node maps. It builds reusable Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) or Deterministic Road Maps (DRM) and applies smoothing filters or Catmull-Rom spline interpolation to output dynamically feasible paths.

### 2. Rapid Re-localization & Kidnapped Robot Recovery
Robots in industrial facilities occasionally lose localization due to rapid dynamic occlusion, symmetrical corridors, wheel slip over spills, or temporary sensor dropouts. The **Robot Re-localization Package** provides an algorithm specifically tuned for mobile robots that swiftly searches candidate poses and restores accurate orientation and position without requiring full manual re-initialization in RViz2.

### 3. Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance & Adaptive Clustering
Static occupancy grids assume a static environment. In real-world environments, moving humans and equipment enter the robot's immediate corridor. Intel's **Adaptive DBSCAN (ADBScan)** algorithm solves the point-density degradation problem of LiDAR and depth cameras by dynamically modulating clustering radii as a function of range. Clustered obstacle bounding boxes feed directly into the **`nav2_adbscan_layer`**, allowing local controllers like DWB and MPPI to execute proactive evasion maneuvers without waiting for slow grid cell decays.

### 4. 3D Volumetric Mapping & Traversability Analysis
To navigate safely through complex 3D environments, robots must identify overhanging obstacles, suspended conveyor belts, low tables, and floor drop-offs. **FastMapping** constructs dynamic 3D voxel representations in real time from RealSense RGB-D feeds, while the **3D Pointcloud Groundfloor Segmentation** package separates traversable ramps and sloped ground from actual physical obstacles.

### 5. Robust State Estimation with LIO & LIVO Pipelines
Wheel encoders slip on slick floors, and 2D scan matchers fail in featureless hallways. The suite integrates direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (**FAST-LIO2**, **Point-LIO**) and direct LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry (**FAST-LIVO2**). These frameworks compute drift-free 6-DoF odometry by fusing solid-state or spinning LiDARs, 6-axis IMUs, and direct photometric visual alignment without compute-intensive feature extractors.

### 6. Multi-Robot Collaborative Mapping
When fleets of robots map an expansive facility simultaneously, **Collaborative Visual SLAM** allows each robot to stream local keyframes and landmarks to a central agent. Intel-optimized SSE, AVX2, and Level-Zero instruction pipelines execute real-time loop closure, global bundle adjustment, and map merging across the entire fleet.

### 7. Autonomous Frontier Exploration (`wandering`)
For unknown environment exploration, the suite provides the **`wandering`** reference application. The robot autonomously discovers frontiers, builds occupancy maps using SLAM (e.g. RTAB-Map or Collaborative SLAM), marks dynamic objects with ADBScan, and navigates toward unexplored regions until full map coverage is achieved.
