# ROS 2 Runtime

The Robotics AI Suite uses the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as its primary runtime execution engine, communication middleware, and lifecycle manager. ROS 2 provides the modular backbone that interconnects sensor ingestion, hardware abstraction, artificial intelligence inference, autonomous navigation, robotic manipulation, and deterministic motor control into a unified software stack.

The suite standardizes on **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco** running on **Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)** across supported Intel platforms. For hardware and platform prerequisites, refer to the [System Requirements](../../platform_foundation/system_requirements.md).


## Architecture & Core Capabilities

ROS 2 delivers an industrial-grade, distributed architecture designed for robotics systems with demanding performance, reliability, and real-time constraints.

### Publish-Subscribe, Services, and Actions

Robotics AI Suite applications communicate across processes and distributed compute nodes using standard ROS 2 communication primitives:

- **Topics (Publish-Subscribe)**: Unidirectional streaming for continuous, high-throughput data such as camera video frames (`sensor_msgs/Image`), 3D point clouds (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`), and odometry measurements (`nav_msgs/Odometry`).
- **Services (Request-Response)**: Synchronous or asynchronous two-way communication for configuration queries, mode switches, and calibration requests.
- **Actions (Goal-Feedback-Result)**: Long-running preemptible task execution with real-time feedback, utilized by Nav2 navigation goals and MoveIt 2 trajectory executions.

### Data Distribution Service (DDS) & Zero-Copy Transport

Communication in ROS 2 relies on Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware implementations such as Fast DDS and Cyclone DDS. The Robotics AI Suite takes advantage of:

- **Intra-Process Communication (IPC)**: Minimizes serialization and socket overhead by using shared memory and loaned messages (`rclcpp::LoanedMessage`) to achieve zero-copy data passing between co-located nodes. This is critical for high-resolution vision and volumetric point-cloud pipelines.
- **Quality of Service (QoS) Tuning**: Configurable reliability (reliable vs. best-effort), durability (transient local vs. volatile), history depth, and deadline/liveliness policies to prioritize critical motor control commands over best-effort diagnostic telemetry.

### Managed Node Lifecycles & Composable Nodes

- **Lifecycle Nodes (`rclcpp_lifecycle`)**: Provides deterministic state-machine management (`unconfigured`, `inactive`, `active`, `finalized`). This allows orchestrating complex robotic graphs where sensor drivers must reach active states before navigation or AI perception nodes begin execution.
- **Composable Nodes & Component Containers**: Packages multiple functional nodes into dynamic shared libraries loaded inside a single runtime process container (`rclcpp_components`), eliminating process boundaries while preserving modular code organization.


## Suite Integration

ROS 2 serves as the central orchestration bus connecting all components in the Robotics AI Suite:

- **AI Perception & Inference**: Interconnects camera feeds with the [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](../../ai_resources/openvino/index.md) inference engine. Vision nodes publish inference bounding boxes, segmented masks, and classification outputs onto standard ROS 2 topics for downstream planning.
- **Sensors**: Interfaces with [Sensors](../sensors/index.md) including Intel® RealSense™ depth cameras (`realsense2_camera`), industrial USB/GMSL vision sensors, and 2D/3D LiDARs.
- **Navigation**: Powers the Nav2 stack, augmented by Intel-optimized components such as the [ITS Path Planner](../optimized_solutions/its-path-planner-plugin.md), [Fast Mapping](../optimized_solutions/run-fastmapping-algorithm.md), and [Robot Re-localization](../optimized_solutions/navigation-relocalization.md).
- **Manipulation**: Integrates MoveIt 2 and MoveIt 2 Servo for Cartesian velocity jog and trajectory execution on multi-axis robotic arms.
- **Real-Time Determinism**: Operates alongside [Real-time Linux PREEMPT_RT](../realtime_determinism/realtime_linux.md) kernels and fieldbuses such as the [IgH EtherCAT Master Stack](../realtime_determinism/ethercat.md) to execute hard real-time control loops.
- **Simulation**: Enables digital-twin testing with [Gazebo Simulation](../simulation/index.md) for full software-in-the-loop (SITL) validation before physical hardware deployment.


## Getting Started with ROS 2

### Installation

ROS 2 Jazzy is included by default when configuring a target system using the Robotics AI Suite:

- **Express & Image Composer**: If you installed the suite using the [Express Setup](../../platform_foundation/getting_started/express.md) or [Image Composer Tool](../../platform_foundation/getting_started/image_composer_tool.md), ROS 2 Jazzy, base dependencies, and Intel platform packages are already installed and configured.
- **Manual Installation**: If performing a custom setup, follow the official [ROS 2 Jazzy installation instructions for Ubuntu](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html).

### Environment Setup

To initialize the ROS 2 environment in your terminal session, source the setup script:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
```

To automatically configure every new shell, append the command to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Network Domain Isolation (`ROS_DOMAIN_ID`)

When multiple robots or development workstations share the same local network, isolate their DDS message traffic by assigning a distinct `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` (integer between `0` and `101`):

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42
```

> [!NOTE]
> Assign each physical robot or independent simulation session a unique `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to prevent node collisions and cross-talk on the local subnet.

### Verifying the Runtime

Verify your ROS 2 runtime and environment configuration:

1. Check runtime environment health:

   ```bash
   ros2 doctor
   ```

2. Test communication between two nodes:

   In one terminal, start a publisher:
   ```bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
   ```

   In a second terminal, start a subscriber:
   ```bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
   ```

3. Inspect active nodes and topics:

   ```bash
   ros2 node list
   ros2 topic list
   ```
